** Update 11/6/01 **

It's a somewhat Shady thing, but I believe that

my code is the most complete out there.

Included sample application shows how to use each function. Code is fully commented and easy to use.

Vote if you like.
 
### More Info
 
See function comments for individual input parameters.

I believe this to be the first example that puts everything together into one neat package and shows you how to use it.

See function comments for output and type

Euphoria,Giddiness, that its finally in one package and you can now read and write those pesky REG_EXPAND_SZ AND REG_MULTI_SZ data types
